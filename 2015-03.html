    title: CQRS/ES with Scala and Akka Persistence with Typesafe's Duncan DeVore
    subtitle: "<p>Fast becoming a hot topic in the world of Reactive JVM applications is CQRS/ES (Command Query Responsibility Segregation and Event sourcing). These design patterns, while not new, present a fresh way to reason about application design that is a natural fit for distributed computing.</p>

    <p>This video talk will explain the rationale behind CQRS/ES, how it fits the Reactive paradigm and the advantages at both the technology and business level. We will also discuss the implications of consistency models and how this approach affects Domain Driven Design.</p>"
